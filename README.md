# Email Guardian: Spam vs. Ham Classifier ðŸš€ðŸ“§

Welcome to the Email Guardian project, where we've harnessed the power of machine learning to create an email classifier that distinguishes between spam and ham messages. This project is designed to help you effortlessly filter through your inbox, identifying and prioritizing emails based on their nature.


## Overview

## Features
Google Colab Integration: Leverage the capabilities of Google Colab for seamless data handling and model training.
CountVectorizer Magic: Transform raw email text into numerical vectors with the powerful CountVectorizer.
Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier: Train the model using a robust text classification algorithm.
User Interaction: Test the model in real-time by entering your own emails for instant predictions.
## Setup
1. Clone the Repository:
#bash

```git clone https://github.com/HHHHemanth/Email_Guardian.git```

```cd Email_Guardian```

2. Install Dependencies:

#bash

```pip install pandas scikit-learn```

3. Run the Project:

Open the Jupyter notebook in Google Colab and run each cell.


## Usage
1. Train the Model:

i) Load your spam and ham datasets into Google Drive.

ii) Update the paths in the notebook to point to your datasets.

iii) Execute the notebook cells to train the model.

2. Test with User Input:

i) After training, the model is ready for action.

ii) Enter your own emails when prompted to see the model in real-time.
